# Scan Site 
This add-on adds a button to your browser's toolbar area. To block a new site (restrict user access) just browse the URL once and press the toolbar button or open the extension's options page and add the hostname (like www.google.com, or *.google.com) in the textbox and press the "add" button. This extension accepts master password to allow website access for a short period of time. If the master password is set, you can browse the restricted sites for a pre-defined time period. Also, this extension can be used to redirect a hostname with its arguments to a new destination instead of blocking a hostname (like redirect to a user-defined blocking page). This feature is useful for instance to redirect a search engine into another search engine.
